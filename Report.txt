I made a creature CRUD using springboot, it's similar to a customer or students CRUD, except
it's more abstract and just general living beings. This assignment was built on top
of the springboot base/template. 

In postman, set the mode to GET and enter http://localhost:8081/api/v1/creatures/all
to retrieve list of current creatures. cRud

To update (update the name, by id, in this case) change mode to POST and 
go http://localhost:8081/api/v1/creatures/update/1/rodney,  crUd

the penultimate part of the address is the id of an existing creature, the last part is the name you want to update the creature to have. updating a non-existing creature returns a temporary 404 creature.

http://localhost:8081/api/v1/creatures/find/1
Displays data for creature of id "1". Trying to find a non existing creature returns a temporary 404 creature. cRud

http://localhost:8081/api/v1/creatures/delete/1
deletes creature that has an id of "1" from the list, deleting a non-existent creature returns a failure message string. cruD

http://localhost:8081/api/v1/creatures/create/5/Roddy Piper 
creates a creature with ID of 5 and name "Roddy Piper" adding a creature with an ID that already exists returns a temporary 404 creature. Crud

The assignment utilizes a custom controller (WebController) and CreatureService and CreatureRepository, as well as a Creature model
